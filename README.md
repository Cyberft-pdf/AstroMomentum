# Orbit Catapult
The program allows users to launch spacecraft from a designated position with the goal of orbiting around a central planet. The spacecraft's trajectory is influenced by gravitational forces, and the user can control the launch direction.

<h1>Key Features:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Gravity simulation with a central planet and spacecraft affected by gravitational force</li>
  <li>User-controlled spacecraft launches based on mouse input</li>
  <li>Visual representation of the planet, spacecraft, and trajectory lines during launch</li>
  <li>Objects disappear upon reaching the screen boundaries or colliding with the planet</li>
</ul>



<h1>How to Use:</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Run the script to launch the simulation window.</li>
  <li>Click and drag to set the launch direction of the spacecraft</li>
  <li>Release the mouse button to launch the spacecraft into orbit</li>
  <li>Observe the spacecraft's trajectory and interactions with the central planet</li>
</ol>

<h1>Dependencies:</h1>

Pygame library for graphics and input handling. Math for mathing

<h3>Note:</h3>
Ensure that the "background.png" and "planet.png" image files are available in the same directory as the script for proper visual elements.
